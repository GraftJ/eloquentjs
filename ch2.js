/**************************************************************

 Looping a triangl
 Write a loop that makes seven calls to the console.log to output the following triangle:

 #
 ##
 ###
 ####
 #####
 ######
 #######
**********************************************************************/

for (let line = "#"; line.length < 8; line += "#")
    console.log(line);

/*****************

 FizzBuzz
 Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
 When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

 *********************/

for (let n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {
    let output = "";
    if (n % 3 === 0)
        output += "Fizz";
    if (n % 5 === 0)
        output += "Buzz";
    console.log(output || n);
}

/**********************

 Chess board
 Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.
 Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #
 # # # #

 When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

 *************************/

    let size = 8;
let board = "";
for (let y = 0; y < size; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
        if ((x + y) % 2 === 0)
            board += " ";
        else
            board += "#";
    }
    board += "\n";
}
console.log(board);
